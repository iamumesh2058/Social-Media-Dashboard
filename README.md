Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) serves as an extension to CSS, functioning as a CSS pre-processor that seamlessly integrates with all CSS versions. Its primary benefit lies in reducing CSS repetition, ultimately saving time in web development. In comparison to traditional styling methods, Sass offers a more efficient approach. It enables the separation of various components, allowing for independent styling. These modular components become easily reusable. Learning Sass has been a valuable addition to my skill set, enhancing my ability to style websites with greater ease and efficiency. This Social Media Dashboard project represents my implementation of Sass learning.
